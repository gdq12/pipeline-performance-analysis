      This view detects rides that appear to be the same but 1 ride has the exact negative `fare amount` 
      compared to the positive value ride. The dimensions that are considered for comparison are 
      `pickup datetime`, `dropoff datetime`, `ratecode ID`, `pickup location ID`, 
      `dropoff location ID`, `passenger count`, `trip distance`. 
      This is based on the recommendation of the this [medium article](https://medium.com/@muhammadaris10/nyc-taxi-trip-data-analysis-45ecfdcb6f91).
