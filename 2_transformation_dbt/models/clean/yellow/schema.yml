      Data loaded into BigQuery using spark cluster in Dataproc. All tables in this schema represent the fist instance  a column_name/ordinal_position/dta_type combo was encountered. When a new combination was encountered, the data  was pushed to a new table. In total, there were 29 different variations of the yellow_tripdata.
